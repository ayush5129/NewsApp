### Description
This News Website is a comprehensive platform for staying updated with the latest news from various sections, including business, sports, entertainment, science, technology, and more. It provides a user-friendly interface to browse, search, and read news articles. The website offers an engaging experience, keeping users informed about current events worldwide.

### Deployment <br>
In this project, I used NewsAPI to fetch news, but it became unsupported when I tried to host it on the webpage. Therefore, I am including images of the project to provide a better understanding of it.
